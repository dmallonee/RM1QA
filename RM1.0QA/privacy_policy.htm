by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). Standing alone, your IP address is not 
sensitive or personally identifiable. We may use IP addresses to collect 
information regarding the frequency with which our visitors visit various parts 
of our sites, and we may combine IP addresses with sensitive or personally

also use your sensitive or personal information for many purposes other than 
sending you materials. (We refer to all of these types of uses of your personal 
information that do not involve the sending of materials as &quot;Operational Uses.&quot;) 
For example, we may use your information to complete transactions requested by 
you (such as your purchase of a service on our websites), or to send you 
administrative communications either about your account or about features of our 
websites, including any future changes to this Privacy Policy. Because these 
uses of your personal information do not involve sending you promotional 
materials your opting-out will not apply to any of these Operational Uses. <o:p></o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Companies with Whom Rate-Highway May Share Information <o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color:black">Rate-Highway may hire companies 
to help provide products or services, like a shipping company that delivers a 
package or a merchant processing service (“Fulfillment Services”). In those 
instances, there is a need to share your information with these companies. Your 
opt-out choices will not apply to sharing by Rate-Highway of your sensitive or 
personal information with any of these companies. Nonetheless, except as 
separately permitted by other provisions of this Privacy Policy, these companies 
are allowed to gather, receive, and use your information only for the purposes 
described in this paragraph or to facilitate compliance with laws. <o:p></o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color:black">Rate-Highway shares information 
with third party service providers, such as credit card processors, auditors, 
attorneys, consultants and contractors, in order to support our websites and 
business operations. We contractually require that these recipients only use the 
information for the intended purpose of the disclosure and that they destroy or 
return the information when it is no longer needed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color:black">From time to time, we may 
purchase a business or sell one or more of our businesses (or portions thereof) 
and your sensitive or personally identifiable information may be transferred as 
a part of the purchase or sale. In the event that we purchase a business, the 
sensitive or personally identifiable information received with that business 
would be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy, if it is practicable 
and permissible to do so. In the event that we sell a business, we will include 
provisions in the selling contract requiring the purchaser to treat your 
sensitive or personally identifiable information in the same manner required by 
this Privacy Policy (including any amendments to this Privacy Policy). In light 
of this protection, your opt-out choices will not affect our right to transfer 
your information to a purchaser in these circumstances. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color:black">Disclosures to Comply With Law 
and to Protect Security and Safety<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color:black">Regardless of any opt-out choices 
that you make, Rate-Highway will disclose sensitive or personal information when 
it believes in good faith that such disclosures (a) facilitate compliance with 
laws, including, for example, compliance with a court order or subpoena, or (b) 
will help to: enforce our Terms of Use or Rate-Monitor End User License 
Agreement; protect your safety or security, including the safety and security of 
property; and/or, protect the safety and security of our Websites, Rate-Highway, 
and/or third parties, including the safety and security of property belonging to 
Rate-Highway or third parties. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color:black">Opting-Out<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color:black">With regard to sensitive or 
personal information that you have provided under this Privacy Policy, an 
opt-out choice is available to you. The opt-out choice is the means by which you 
give us, or decline to give us, your consent to use your sensitive or personal 
information. Please note that opting out may limit or prohibit your use of some 
or all of the online features of the Rate-Highway websites and services. You can 
exercise your opt-out choice by logging into our Websites, and clicking on our 
Privacy Policy link and following the opt-out directions as described below. <o:p></o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color:black">You may choose to opt-out of 
receiving certain materials from Rate-Highway. For your convenience, when you 
make a choice regarding this opt-out, we will treat that choice as replacing any 
other choices regarding any opt-out that you may previously have made. <o:p></o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color:black">Please keep in mind that any 
opt-out choice you make will not apply in situations where (a) you either have 
made, simultaneously make, or later make a specific request for information from 
Rate-Highway, (b) Rate-Highway uses your sensitive or personal information for 
either &quot;Operational Uses&quot; or &quot;Fulfillment Uses&quot; (as described above) (c) you 
either have engaged, simultaneously engage, or later engage in transactions or 
(d) Rate-Highway shares your sensitive or personal information with respect to 
&quot;Purchase or Sale of Businesses,&quot; or &quot;Disclosures to Comply with Law and to 
Protect Security and Safety, Rate-Highway and Others.&quot; Also, any opt-out choice 
you make will not apply to sensitive or personal information that you provide 
about other persons, but these other persons will also have the opportunity to 
opt-out of receiving promotional materials. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color:black">It may take up to ninety (90) 
days for your opt-out choice to be fully effective. Our systems require time to 
update, and mailings using your sensitive or personal information shared before 
your opt-out may already be in process. Finally, please keep in mind that, if 
you have not consistently used the same postal and email addresses on our 
websites, or if you have used a general change of address process (such as the 
change of address process offered by the U.S. Post Office) after providing 
address information on our websites, systems maintained Rate-Highway may have 
varying contact information for you. Accordingly, it may not always be possible 
to match your new opt-out choice with your sensitive or personal information 
that you previously provided. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color:black">The security and confidentiality 
of your information is extremely important to us. We have implemented technical, 
administrative, and physical security measures to protect your information from 
unauthorized access and improper use. From time to time, we review our security 
procedures in order to consider appropriate new technology and methods. Please 
be aware though that, despite our best efforts, no security measures are perfect 
or impenetrable. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
